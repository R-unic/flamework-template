# My Flamework Template

This is my own pre-configured template you can use for your Roblox TypeScript projects that use [Flamework](https://fireboltofdeath.dev/docs/flamework/).  
It includes a few extra utilities.

## Usage

First, create the folder on your computer where you want your project to be stored.
Then, open a terminal at that directory and run the following commands:

```console
npx degit R-unic/flamework-template
npm i
```

That's it! The template has been installed. For further information on how to use Flamework in your project, please see [here](https://fireboltofdeath.dev/docs/flamework).
